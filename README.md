Press F for the time spent on this app.<br>
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF (No, intelliJ, this is not a typo.)

My first ever Electron app. Big F.

**Collection**<br>
Just clone the repo, actually.

**Preparation for building**<br>
Run `npm i` or a yarn equivalent if you have one.<br>
Make sure you have a recent-ish version of Java. This might need it. Or not, depends whether I've refactored the code yet.

**Running the code**<br>
Use `npm start` or `electron-forge start`. The first one just uses the second one.

**Building**<br>
You must be on the platform you wish to build for. Then execute `electron-forge make --arch=INSERT_YOUR_ARCHITECTURE_HERE`, where the arch may be ia32 or x64.
Electron-forge provides support for ARM, but I won't help you with it.<br>
